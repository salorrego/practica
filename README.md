# What in here for you in one paragraph

Node.js has great frameworks üíö, they never meant to be production ready - Practica.js bridges this gap. Based on your preferred framework, we generate a small code that demonstrates a full flow, from API to DB, that is packed with good practices. For example, we incude a hardened dockerfile, N-Tier folder structure, great testing templates, and more. This can save a great deal of time and painful mistakes. All our decisions are being made, [thoughtfully and neatly documented](/docs/decisions), we strive to keep things as simple and standard as possible and base our work on the popular guide ['Node.js best practices'](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices)

# A very quick start

üóì **Alpha project:** This project is very premature WIP, please revisit by June 2022

### Run this command from terminal

Interactive mode with UI:

`npx @practica/create-node-app interactive` 

Or a typical terminal command using flags (without UI):

`npx @practica/create-node-app immediate` 

### ‚ú® That's it, the code was generated for you 

### Start the project

`npm start`

or

`npm test`

Standard, ah?

### Enjoy

- ‚úÖ Start coding. The code is short by design and you should get up to speed quick
- ‚úÖ Understand the project structure by watch [this 5 min YouTube (coming soon) üìπ](https://github.com/practicajs/practica/blob/main/docs/not-ready-yet.md)
- ‚úÖ Optional: Skim through the code, all the best practices are tagged inside the code
- ‚úÖ Master it by visiting our [documentation website (coming soon)](https://practica.org)

# Our philosophy and unique value

### 1. Best practices _on top of_ known Node.js frameworks

We don't invent new wheels rather use your favorite framework and empower it with more structure and practices. For example, with a single command you get express/fastify based code base with ~100 additional best practices inside

![Built on top of known frameworks](/docs/images/on-top-of-frameworks.png)

### 2. SIMPLE like Node.js was meant to be

Keeping it simple, flat and based on native Node/JS capabilities is part of this project DNA. We believe that too many abstractions, high-complexity and fancy language features become soon a strategic slowdown for the team. To name a few example, our code flow is flat with almost no level of indirection, although using TypeScript - almost no features are being used besides types, for modularization we simply use... Node.js modules

![Built on top of known frameworks](/docs/images/abstractions-vs-simplicity.png)

### 3. Supports many technologies and frameworks

Since it's about good practices and simplicity, there is no need to narrow this code to specific framework or DB. We aim to support the major Node.js frameworks and databases

# Practices and features

We apply more than 100 practices and optimizations, you can opt-in or out for most of these features using our CLI flags. Following is few examples of features, to learn about the full list of features, [please visit here](https://practicajs.org/features)
